<h2>Design Process</h2>

<h3>Research & Problem Discovery</h3>
<p>The project was began by researching the pain points in the current educational system in metro cities, focusing on communication gaps and the difficulty students have in discovering opportunities like clubs, extracurricular activities, and career guidance.</p>

<h3>Wireframing & Prototyping</h3>
<p>The Figma design incoporates user flows for three distinct user types—students, parents, and teachers—and created wireframes for each stage of the user journey. The design was iterated based on feedback and user testing.</p>

<h3>User Testing & Feedback</h3>
<p>After creating the initial designs, testing was conducted with students, parents, and teachers to ensure the app’s features addressed their needs and provided a seamless experience.</p>
